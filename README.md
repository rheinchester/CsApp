# CsApp
This is my first c# app. Inspired by [Brad traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/). 
# About
Basically it is a game where users interact with a cli to guess the right right number.
# Intent
The aim of this mini project was to give my self a formal intro to c#. 

Hopefully I would find a reason to write more c# in the future
